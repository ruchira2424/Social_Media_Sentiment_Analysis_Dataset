# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Task9.ipynb`) and a dataset (`3) Sentiment dataset.csv`) for analyzing social media posts with sentiment labels. The dataset includes social media posts from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, along with metadata such as sentiment, timestamps, user information, hashtags, retweets, likes, country, and more.

The Jupyter Notebook provides initial exploration of the dataset using Python libraries (`pandas` and `numpy`) to load and display the data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (`3) Sentiment dataset.csv`) contains the following columns:
- **Unnamed: 0.1, Unnamed: 0**: Index columns (likely from data export).
- **Text**: The content of the social media post.
- **Sentiment**: Sentiment label (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral, Happy).
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the post.
- **User**: Username or identifier of the poster.

## Files
- **Task9.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to load and preview the dataset using `pandas`. It displays the first 20 and last 20 rows of the dataset.
